# Continuous dhdotcom Development

## Overview
- I am continuously developing this site.

### Goals
- Explore new technologies

I just don't know how to write.

I spent an entire night trying to track down and determine how to best server render my MDX.

It's not that easy.


### Worked on
- [x] Server rendering MDX
- [ ] Server rendering MDX with syntax highlighting
- [ ] Authentication: Magic Link
- [ ] Dummy MDX content
- [] Category bar and filtering
- []

### Issues
- I just cannot find good free resources for Genetics and Genomics
- I MIGHT HAVE FOUND SOME OK ONES.
