# Continuous dhdotcom Development

## Overview

- I am continuously developing this site.

### Goals

- Explore new technologies

I just don't know how to write.

I spent an entire night trying to track down and determine how to best server render my MDX.

It's not that easy.

I am somewhat happy with how things are turning out in this app. But I'm about to enter a few weeks of focused working which will limit my timem to work on this project.

### Purpose

I think I may just try to write stream of concsiousness....but I really need to figure out how to turn off predictive text in vscode.

I want to learn how to generate metdatat for this site better. I started this site to learn Nextjs app router and use server actions and server components. It's been fun but a littl hectic. I would say I was a moderately knowledgable remix coder. If you call my DIY apps as actual coding.

I am interested in exploring more aspects of genetics and variant classification. What's next for the field? I am actually not sure. While I have learned a great deal of things in my current position I haven't spent much time planning for the future. I will do that now.

But it looks like I did finally solve it

### Code to turn off text prediction in vscode

```json
    "[mdx]": {
  "editor.quickSuggestions": {
    "other": false,
    "comments": false,
    "strings": false
  },
  "editor.suggest.showWords": false,
  "editor.inlineSuggest.enabled": false
}
```

### Worked on

- [x] Server rendering MDX
- [ ] Server rendering MDX with syntax highlighting
- [ ] Authentication: Magic Link
- [ ] Dummy MDX content
- [] Category bar and filtering
- [x] Used V0 to help me with some responsive design. I am not a designer but I do try to do most thing my self. I often search for a solution to understand how to accomplish it at a basic level. Usually my usecase isn't as basic.

### Issues

- I just cannot find good free resources for Genetics and Genomics
- I MIGHT HAVE FOUND SOME OK ONES.

### TODos

- [ ] Add a category bar
- [ ] Add a search bar
- [ ] Scope a User Forums
- [ ] Find someone to help me with the design
- [ ] Add a contact form
- [ ] Add a newsletter
- [ ] Add a projects section
- [ ] Add a resume section
- [x] Add a blog section
- [x] Add a about section
- [ ] Add a contact section
- [ ] Add a footer
- [ ] Add an Overlay ba
- [ ] Add a forums section

### Categories

The categories are obtained from the top of the FrontMatter of the MDX files. During the initial development I thought that I would confirm that these are dynammic and can be made up of many different tags. I'm not sure about this approach.

Maybe I should not rely on static category tags but instead come up with a basic set and expand upon those in the future.
